# Mini Rocket Body – SolidWorks Beginner Project

## Overview
This repository documents my first SolidWorks project, created to learn basic 3D CAD modeling tools and workflow.

## Software
- SOLIDWORKS (Student Version)

## Model Description
The model is a simplified rocket body consisting of:
- Cylindrical main body
- Revolved nose cone
- Additional revolved geometry at the base
- Filleted edges

The design is conceptual and intended for CAD learning purposes.

## Features Used
- Sketch
- Boss-Extrude
- Revolved Boss/Base
- Fillet
- Circular Pattern

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned basic sketching and constraints
- Used extrude and revolve features
- Understood feature order and rebuild logic
- Fixed revolve sketch errors

## Future Work
- Cleaner geometry transitions
- Assembly-based modeling
- Introductory simulations
